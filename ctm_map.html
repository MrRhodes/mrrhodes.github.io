                        <h3>Swanley House (Cheshire)</h3>
                        <h4>Swanley Lane, Nantwich, Cheshire, CW5 8QB</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>Swanley is beautiful place in the Cheshire, birthplace of Cheshire cheeses and the Cheshire cat from Alice in the Wonderland. Unfortunately I did not bump into Mr Cat, but I did see the Llangollen Canal, which is as beautiful as it is hard to pronounce. Unfortunately, the boats do not appreciate you navigate canal on lilo in swimming trunks, but luckily the camp site is have a landscaped pool which is even have it&rsquo;s own miniature fishes! They like to nibble at claws. I not manage to wash feet for 7 days so I think fishes have good feast!</p><p>Swanley is allow you to bring all kind of pets, not just swans, which means pet coackroach Nibbles is get chance to stretch his little legs in cockroach ball. </p><p>The site is have electric hookup for touring caravans, which mean I could safely use my hairdryer to make myself look good before visit local pub the Farmers Arms. Is much friendlier place than Meerkovo&rsquo;s Queasy Mongoose, but do not expect any centipede scratchings &ndash; the bar staff never even hear of them!</p><p>Instead I eat at delicious local Chinese takeaway. Is first time I ever eat this kind of food, but it remind me of eating crickets &ndash; no matter how many you eat you are hungry again one hour later! </p>

                        <h3>Dean Wood Holidays Caravan and Campsite (Gloucestershire)</h3>
                        <h4>Yorkley Wood Road, Yorkley, Lydney, Gloucestershire, GL15 4TY</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>Dean wood caravan site is base in forest of Dean. I am not sure who Mr Dean is, but he is own very picturesque, quiet and peaceful forest. The site is have lots of open space so I can work on my swingerball technique in peace. After work up sweat I visit the site&rsquo;s heated shower block, which make welcome change to having stand-up wash infront of wash basin. There are some parts of a meerkats body that you just cannot reach when standing up.</p><p>Dean&rsquo;s Wood is have 50 caravan spaces, most of which have electric connections. Is even have washing up room. I get to experience washing up in whole new environment! Is very exciting.</p><p>Dean&rsquo;s forest is fill with many deer. Rumour has it there is elusive white deer that only a few peoples see every year. I have several children race up to me and try to catch, but they are always disappoint when they realise white deer is in fact grey meerkat.</p><p>I console myself by visit the Indoor Play Barn, which is fill with many fun things, like space hopper and pedal tractor. Unfortunately I was not allowed on bouncy castle due to potential claw-related puncturings, but it look like good fun from outside. I make do with a few laps on space hoppings instead. </p>

                        <h3>Old Station Caravan Park (Mid Wales)</h3>
                        <h4>New Radnor, Powys, Mid Wales, LD8 2SS</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>When I hear name &lsquo;Old Station&rsquo; caravan park, I knew I have to make journey. I have been big fan of steam strain ever since Tank Engine Thomas make it to Meerkovo on the Betamax. Although I find no trains with smiley faces, I find old railway ticket office that have been turn into holiday cottage and also a Goods Shed with original old crane that was once use for loading real life trains!</p><p>After I take 43 photos of cranes, I venture into rest of caravan site. I find charming tea room with wifi connections (so I can send crane photos back to Mr Aleksandr &ndash; I know he like look at them), showers and clean toilet blocks.</p><p>Caravan site is own by nice couple name Libby and John Roe. They are allow you to have BBQ&rsquo;s on site, so we get to know each other over juicy scorpion, although they must have very small appetites as they not eat very much.</p><p>Caravan plots are have electric hook ups, which was handy for marathon Tetris session (I reach level 3!). Unfortunately dogs are allowed, and I spend a whole afternoon avoiding the attentions of curious spaniel, but with many nearby things to do like bird watch, canoeing and visit Llandrindod Wells, I have easy enough time dodge little Rover for rest of stay. </p>

                        <h3>Woodlands Grove Caravan and Camping Park (Dartmouth)</h3>
                        <h4>Blackawton, Dartmouth, Devon TQ9 7DQ</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>If I had to take Mr Aleksandr on caravan holiday, (I already ask and he say he think nothing worse then spend 2 weeks in small box with me. I not mind, is more more bed space for me) then I would take to Woodlands Grove. The campsite Vanity Unit and nearby falconry centre are two of Mr Aleksandr&rsquo;s favourite hobbies.</p><p>Campsite is base in South Devon, where all the peoples are speak like the Blackbeard. The pirate accent is explain all the boats, as there are lots of fun things to do on the water nearby. I hire pedlo from Dartmouth Boat Hire Centre and spend day peddle on the waters. They say you learn something new everyday, and that day I learn is very possible to be seasick on pedlo. If you are feel more adventurous, you can go sailing at nearby Salcombe, but Pedlos are enough adventure for me. </p><p>When my claws were safely back on dry land, I go to Woodlands Family Theme Park, which is fill with lots of fun things like watercoasters (like rollercoaster, but with more wet), climbing nets and tree top adventures. After long day climbing the nets, I was glad of free hot showers, fur-dryers, and ironing boards. There is nothing like a good shirt ironing session to relax after busy day. </p>

                        <p>Willow Holt is sound like name of tiny Hobbit village, and I was not disappoint. Although is filled with normal size peoples with normal size feet, is have all the peace and quiet I expect from sleepy village I imagine in my head. Is perfect place to put up claws and have nice relax time.</p><p>The campsite is close to many exotic location which I never visit before include Skegness, which is much nicer place than it sound, and Lincoln Cathedral which blow me over with its architechings &ndash; in Meerkovo our church is community centre that also double as bingo hall.</p><p>No pets are allowed, which means I could study my blueprints of Apollo 7 rocket engines without fear of being interrupt by strange dog sniffle around my cool box.</p><p>The two fishing lakes in campsite give me perfect place to practice my fish catch technique. Apparently you can catch fish up to 30lbs in weight (that is almost as big as me!) but I make do with tiddly little fishy. I named him Samuel. He was delicious.</p><p>Campsite is have steamy hot showers and is close to many shop, supermarket and a handy post office so I can tell Mr Aleksandr about my bird watching progress. I know he would not want to miss latest update. </p><p>Speaking of bird watch, Willow Holt is very good place for go the bird watching. I manage to tick many birds from my list. All I am have to do is spot flamingo and first page of checklist will be complete! I am keep my claws crossed&#8230; </p>

                        <p>Riverside Caravan Park is in place called Devon, famous for clot cream. The site have many facility include electric caravan cables and hot showers, but my favourite was the laundry and ironing room. I spend whole afternoon there. Is not often you get to experience folding shirt and ties in foreign country. Is very strange experience &ndash; definitely something to tell the grandpups!</p><p>The area is filled with many different animals include stoats, weasels, bats, badgers and even otters, although my Papa always tell me never trust an otter. Apparently Papa lend his otter friend 30 Rubles in 1974 and he never see it again. My favourite local animal is the butterfly &ndash; there were many flapping around the meadows and river walks, although they are very hard to catch, so I never manage to taste one.</p><p>The campsite is also a stoney throw from place called Plymouth, which is UK&rsquo;s ocean city. It have many ferries and dinghies going to this place and that, but none of them go to Meerkovo. I even get to explore real life navy ship, although I was ask to leave when Titanic impression at front of ship disturb nearby tour group. </p>

                        <p>When I make visit to the Devon, a man name Mr Ross was very kind to let me park my caravan in his park. Is have many spacious hard stand pitchings, all with electronic hook ups. There are showers with free hot water, toilet block and special dish washing room (which really make me feel at home).</p><p>Dogs are welcome, and they even have special dog shower with dog hair dryer! Personally I am not fan of dog in caravan park, but if a dog is going to jump on my and try to steal sandwich, I would rather it was a clean dog.</p><p>They also have whole room dedicated to a &lsquo;sport&rsquo; call snooker. I never hear it before, but is feature men in waistcoats try to make all the balls disappear by poking them with long sticks. I find is very good sleep aid.</p><p>Ross Park is have special &lsquo;conservation area&rsquo;, which feature many different butterflies and insects. I am not sure what &lsquo;conservation&rsquo; is mean, but judging from the amount I eat that afternoon, I assume is translate into something like &lsquo;buffet&rsquo;, of perhaps &lsquo;cafeteria&rsquo;. I would especially recommend the crickets. Tasty.</p><p>My favourite was the tropical internet caf&eacute;, which is feature many exotic plants that remind me of my ancestors homeland, except it has the internet! It allow me to get in touch with my roots and check emailings at the same time.</p><p>Best of all Ross Park is very close to a place call &lsquo;Diggerland&rsquo;.

                        <h3>Dol-Lys Farm Caravan and Camping (Mid Wales)</h3>
                        <h4>Trefeglwys Rd, Llanidloes, Powys SY18 6JA</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>Dol&ndash;Lys farm is one of favourite spot in the Wales. The campsite is 7 acres large and you can park caravan near river or bushes. I was choose by bushes as is easy to catch insect for midnight snack.</p><p>Campsite also have large area for ball games and was perfect for my swingerball. There was even enough room to swing a hat! At night time I was ables to enjoy delicious roast marsh-millipedes over fire, as Campsite allow fires.</p><p>There are also toilet and electric shower which only cost 20 of your UK pennies to use. It was great spot for enjoy wide variety of locals wildlife like sheep, lamb, or even rams. Luckily there was no dragons - I hear they are big fan of toasted meerkat.</p><p>When I was not enjoy local wild life I relax with game of golf at St. Idloes Golf Club. For the 18 holes par is 66 but I wash smash record with 113. Look like all those games of corridors golf with Mr Aleksandr was pay off.</p><p>There is also free fishing on site. I give try but not catch single fish. Maybe is because I eat all bait on way to river. I then visit Clywedog reservoir (which almost sound like Russian place) and taste the local bugs and grubs. I was also visit Bryntail lead mine where &lsquo;Meer&rsquo; space program is get its lead from for rocket ships - fascinating. </p>

                        <p>I originally went to Crows Nest Caravan Park because I thought I would get to meet many pirates. I was silly mongoose, everyone know that pirates live in West country!</p><p>What I did find was high tech caravan park with many feature including WiFi. Orlov mansion not even have WiFi. I keep tell Aleksandr to invest in WiFi but he say no such thing exist and is only mongoose sorcery. </p><p>Caravan site is even provide entertainment. During stay &lsquo;Disco Dave&rsquo; was play some of my favourite hit including &lsquo;I&rsquo;m blue&rsquo; by Eiffel 65. I then enjoy shoot some of the pool. I not think other caravaners realize I was local Meerkovo champion in 1969. Caravan park was even have swimming pool with slide, is nearly as impressive as Mr Aleksandr&rsquo;s bathtub.</p><p>Nearby I also find beautifuls stretch of beach. I spend much time on beach fishing and snacking on local seafood found in rock pools. I even try my claw at surfing and was ables to stand up for whole 2.6 second. </p><p>&lsquo;Int Yorkshire&rsquo; is customary to drink cup of tea every 10 minute. I try to take part in tradition but it was harder than look. Yorkshire peoples not drink delicious fruitfly tea but tea made from dry leaves and mix with milk from cow! Crazy!  </p>

                        <p>After visit the old forest I decide to visit the New Forest and Furzehill farm was my favourite caravan spot in in whole area. </p><p>It was cozy and simples campsite with only 5 caravan spot, each with its own electric hook up. Site is perfect as it open directly into New Forest which mean you not have to go far to find great walk or burrowing spot.</p><p>The New Forest is famous for its wildlife. While there I was eat many delicious snake, lizard, bugs, grubs and spiders, delicious. I gain one whole pound in just 3 day! Now I am back on stick insect diet. </p><p>The New Forest is also infest with ponies. But they are not like riding pony from the Blackpool beach. I try to feed one a carrot and he chase for 3 kilometer. I eventually escape by throwing carrot in hedge. At least it help me burn off some of the delicious grubs.  </p>

                        <h3>Robin Hood Caravan and Camping Park (North Yorkshire)</h3>

                        <p>Base in the North of Yorkshire, this site is named after the character invented by Kevin Costner in one of Mr Aleksandr&rsquo;s most favourite films &ndash; Prince of Thievings. Although it sound like is based in old fashioned times, the camp site is actually nice and modern, with electronic hooking ups for all caravan and rejuvenated shower block with fur dryer and even shaving point. They are also have laundry room that make me feel right at home, although it did mean I bring my ironing board for no reasons.</p><p>BBQ&rsquo;s are allowed, which means you get enjoy delicious flame grill centipede whenever you are fancy. But unfortunately, pets are also allowed, which means I have to be super vigilant to keep scorpion steaks safe from strange dogs.</p><p>Wireless WiFi allow me to surf on internet without using any wires. Is magic! You do not even need to plug anything into your phoneline! </p><p>Nearby is tiny town called Helmsley, which remind me of Meerkovo, but with less furry residents. They have many nice places to eat, include an award winning ice cream shop! In Russia we not eat many ice-creams - is so cold that there is risk your tongue will stick to cone, but ice creams in the Helmsley is much more tasty. I bring some back for Mr Aleksandr, but it melt and now there is Neapolitan all over my sleeping bag.</p><p>Caravan site is also very close to place called North Yorkshire Moors. It was lovely place to take bicycle out for nice long ride and enjoy scenery. I hope to come back soon and try ride again without using stabilisers. </p>

                        <h3>Dolbeare Park Caravan and Camping (Cornwall)</h3>
                        <h4>Landrake, Saltash, Cornwall PL12 5AF</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>Dolbeare is based near place called the Corn Wall, which sounds like delicious place to visit. Is in heart of Cornish country side, famous for pasties (I could not find Weevil pastie anywhere), surfings and sailings.</p><p>The site has electric pipes for all caravan, which meant I could watch as many episodes of Miami Vice on Betamax as I like in evenings. Best of all, Dolbeare was once award 5 star loo of the year in 2010! It was very clean. I imagine is how the Queen feel when she use her toilet.</p><p>Dogs are allowed, but only good ones, which means I not have to worry so much when I BBQ my scorpion sausages, although in my experience even good dogs can turn bad at smell of sizzling scorpion sausage.</p><p>I also have chance to pretend to be Robin Hood on real life archery range. Is make nice change to get chance to fire arrow rather than just stand at end of corridor and collect Mr Aleksandr&rsquo;s arrows. But better than arrows was the giant chess set. Is like regular chess but with pieces as big as me! I beat 9 year old girl and then two 7 and half year old twins to maintain unbeaten chess record!</p><p>Nearby there is place called Adrenalin Quarry which have the UK&rsquo;s longest zipping wire. It stretch all the way across flooded quarry and fly really fast. After that excitement, when I get home I could only make it through 7 minutes of Miami Vice episode. I must have been very tired! </p>

                        <p>Masons campsite is found right in centre of place called &lsquo;Yorkshire Dales&rsquo;. I not know much about the Yorkshire, but if Yorkshire pudding is anything to go by then is very delicious county.</p><p>The campsite itself was very peacefuls and have many facilities. The showers have renovate in 2011, and are able to cope with impressive amounts of meerkat fur go down drain without being clogged. They are even have underfloor heating, which is most luxury I ever experience. Is like wear snuggly warm slippers on your paws all the time.</p><p>BBQ&rsquo;s are allowed and many delicious local meats are provide from nearby place called the Grassington, although the supply of scorpion steaks is limited so get there quick!</p><p>Campsite also specialize in something called &lsquo;glamping&rsquo;. I am told is mixture of camping and glamour. Perhaps is camping in a ball gown? I not imagine that would be very comfortables though.</p><p>If you happen to forget your caravan (I have done that several times, is very frustrating), then you can rent retro Volkswagen beetle, which I am told is give genuine experience of what it was like to go camp in the 60s, but with less hippies. </p><p>Nearby there is place called Bolton Abbey, where you can find Hesketh farm. Here you can meet many different animals, but I choose to stay away due to incident I have with goat in 1982. I not been able to look one in the eye since. But I am sure the goats at Hesketh farm are much more friendly. </p>

                        <p>Bryn Bach is lovely caravan site in the North of Wales, where it feel like most peoples are speak in alien dialect. I later learn that they were in fact speak Welsh.</p><p>Before I come I hear about famous dish called the Welsh Rabbit, but they must have been out of rabbit that day, because I all get was cheese on toast. I not say anything out of politeness. Other than lack of rabbits, campsite was very pleasant. All caravans have hooking up to the electric, and the showers are hot enough to steam up my glasses.</p><p>Campsite is also have dedicate BBQ and picnic area, which is great place to eat peanut beetle and jelly sandwich while use the free WiFi to catch up on all news from Floppy Disk weekly website.</p><p>For meerkats who are young at hearts (like me), high adrenaline activity like wakeboarding, windsurf and waterski are availables at Abersoch beach. Banana ride was my favourite. Is one of fastest pieces of fruit I ever ride.</p><p>Although not quite as fast as banana boat, ride the horse is another popular thing to do around campsite, and you can rent horse from many places with funny sounding name, include Abersoch, Cilan, Llaniestyn, Llanbedrog or Waunfawr. You can even ride up to Snowdonia, but unfortunately I was unable to make the long and difficult climb - I had to wash my fur that day.</p>

                        <p>When I arrive in Tudor park, I was expect to see peoples in old fashioned frilly Shakespeare clothes. Unfortunate I am told they went out of fashion hundreds of year ago, but despite lack of old clothing, Tudor park is still great caravan park.</p><p>All caravan&rsquo;s have electronic hook ups, which means I can use my popped corn roach maker without worry about batteries, and only nice dogs are allowed, which means I do not need worry about angry Alsatian making off with my fresh popped corn roaches.</p><p>There is place nearby called Wetlands Centre, which is very good place to see rare birds. My favourite was the flamingo. I have never seen anything so pink yet so threatening. I am glad they only have one leg, otherwise I am sure they would have chased and try eat me with their evil looking beaks. They also have beavers. They are not quite as elegant as flamingos, but they have very impressive building skills. I make enquirings to see if there are any available to build extention onto my bedroom.</p><p>Nearby is place called Berkeley Castle which have very bloodstain history. Apparently King Edward the 2nd was murder there, which means it is officially haunted castls. I use caravan site wifi to call Mr Aleksandr to tell him about the royal ghosts in the castle, but he say I just eat too much sugar again and imagine things.</p><p>I also enjoy time at Westonbirt National Arboretum, which is like a zoo for trees. Is better than real zoo in many ways &ndash; as trees make much less dung and do not try to bite your paws off when you pet them, unlike the tigers at Moscow zoo. </p>

                        <p>This campsite is base in place called Devon, which is one of my favourite part of UK. The campsite is have electrical hookings up for every caravan and nice clean bathroom for when you have to make visit to the little meerpups room in middle of night. Unfortunately they are also pet friendly, which means you have to look out for excitable puppies when eat your scorpion sandwich outside. </p><p>Moor View is for adults only &ndash; no meerpups allowed! This make for extremely relax holiday, and for once I manage to finish a whole crossword in only three days! Is amazing what you can achieve with little peace and quiet and popular internet search engine.</p><p>I also make visit to nearby Sharpham Vineyard, which is make many vintage beetle juice, but unfortunately I could not find Aleksandr&rsquo;s favourite vintage anywhere. They not have Stag Beetle Shiraz, Millepede Merlot, and not even a drop of Centipede Sauvignon. I will have to bring him gift of sticker of rock instead.</p><p>I also make visit to nearby Dartmoor, which feature many wild ponies, and lots of speckly rock called granite. Is make wonderful kitchen work surface, so I fill my pockets to take back to Meerkovo. After another 300 trips I may have enough to fit new kitchen.</p><p>I have also been told that many period drama have been film in this area. I will have to take photograph for Mr Aleksandr as &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo; are two of his favourite things! </p>

                        <h3>Blue Bell Pond Caravan Site (Yorkshire)</h3>

                        <p>While &lsquo;Int Yorkshire&rsquo; I was pay visit to Blue Bell Pond Caravan Site. Blue Bell is type of delicious flower only find in United Kingdoms. Is have big military heritage and even have some bunkers and gun battlements left! I like pretend I am in war fighting the evil mongoose enemy.</p><p>However campsite is not all barracks. They also have electric hook ups for caravan, shower block and BBQ&rsquo;s. Perfect for my home make sticky fruitfly wings. </p><p>While in area I make visit to famous bird watching spot Spurn Point. I hear that area is famous for spot rare birds but all I see is bald eagle and dodo. Spurn Point is also good for another of my hobby - fossil hunting. Unfortunates I was not find T-Rex tail that was miss from my collection.</p><p>I also visit Spurn Point lighthouse and was amaze by size of light bulb. I think reason lighthouse is no longer use is because owner man cannot find new light bulb that fit.  </p>

                        <h3>Runswick Bay Caravan and Camping Park (North Yorkshire)</h3>

                        <p>While in North Yorkshire I was stay at Runswick Bay Caravan and camping park. They have everything from electric hook up to shower block. </p><p>While in area I visit the Captain Hook Museum. I was very excite about learning about Peter Pan&rsquo;s nemesis but when I get closer to museum I realize is not about Captain Hook but Captain Cook, some chef who was promoted to captain of ship. Although he not have hook for hand he was very interesting person and was credit with discover New Zealand and Australia. Wow. I wonder if he could find my lost cuff link in mansion. I was so impress with Captain Cook that I end up treating myself to special biro with his face on it.</p><p>I also visit Pannett Park witch contain many pretty flower and delicious bug inside them. Park also have art gallery with famous paintings. It give me idea to try my claw at watercolour back at caravan site but I was no good. I have hear that chopping off ear is improve claw eye co-ordination? Maybe I will stick with MS paint on computermabob.</p>

                        <h3>Abdo Hill Farm (Shropshire)</h3>
                        <h4>Rosehill, Nr. Market Drayton, Shropshire, TF9 2JF</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>While visit Shropshire I was stay at the delightfuls Abdo Hill Farm which have electric hook ups, hot showers and their very own chickens. Which mean you can have soft boiled egg and comrades every morning if you like.</p><p>Shropshire is like land time forgot with beautifuls black and white buildings, abbeys and castles. Many of the buildings are have timber frames. I was have my claws cross for tasty wood termite snacking but was not so lucky. So instead I try local delicacy &lsquo;shrewsbury cake&rsquo; - delicious even without wood termites.</p><p>While on travels I visit many medieval castles in Ludlow, Stokesay and Clun. They are little small but I think they would make perfect holiday home for Mr Aleksandr.   In Shropshire I was visit Shrewsbury, the birthplace of famous scientist and zoo keeper Mr Charles Darwin. Mr Darwin was famous for his theory of evolutions and for saying humans were evolve from monkey. I wonder what he think meerkats evolve from? My guess is pterodactyl.</p>

                        <h3>The Orchard Campsite (Suffolk)</h3>
                        <h4>Woodbridge, Suffolk IP13 0SJ</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>While UFO spotting in Rendlesham forest in Suffolk I was stay at the Orchard Campsite. It have many hi-tech feature like wifi, electric hook ups, shower blocks and freesat tv. But my favourite feature was definitely the Observatory. It remind me of good old days at &lsquo;meer&rsquo; space station. I spend many hour looking up at famous star constellations such as andromeerda and Orion&rsquo;s pelt.</p><p>During my visit the campsite also host &lsquo;Alien Encounter&rsquo; night which was much fun. I go as ET. I take off glasses, put towel over head and sit in basket with tomato sauce on claw. I think it work well, Mr Aleksandr is always say I could be Mr ET&rsquo;s brother.</p><p>Campsite also offer river where you can fish. I was get excite as I hear it was full of roach, but it turn out this just name of fish and not actual cockroach.</p><p>For extra specials weekend you could even book your very own gypsy caravan, although I not think it come with fortune telling claw-reading gypsy.  </p>
